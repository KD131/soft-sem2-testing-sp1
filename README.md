## 1. Reflections

### 1.1. Shooting

> A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.

The first couple reasons contradict the fact that _a shot was fired_, but they're worth mentioning.

1. Safety on
2. Out of bullets/no ammunition
3. Blanks
4. Misfire
5. Missed the target
6. Non-fatal wound
7. Superman/cheats enabled
8. Water gun

### 1.2. Alien

> An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)

1. Pick up toothbrush in your dominant hand.
2. Stick the tip of the toothbrush in running water to wet the bristles.
3. Pick up tube of toothpaste.
4. Unscrew cap of toothpaste by turning the cap anti-clockwise.
5. Position the tip of the tube along the bristles of the toothbrush.
6. Squeeze the tube to spread toothpaste unto the bristles.
7. Wet the bristles again, now with the toothpaste on it.
8. Stick the tip of the toothbrush into your mouth along your bottom teeth.
9. Gently make circular motions along the row of teeth.
10. Also do the backside of the teeth.
11. Repeat steps 8-10 for the top row of teeth.
12. Spit out remaining toothpaste into a sink.
13. Wash tip of the toothbrush.
14. Put away toothbrush and toothpaste.

## 3. Give Your Thoughts On TDD

> - What was positive and good about using TDD?
> - What was annoying or difficult?
> - What surprised you?
> - Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?

Writing the simplest solution to pass the test first, in a lot of cases seems entirely redundant.
There's almost no value in having a function that simply returns `-40` in all cases, so why write that to begin with?

The idea is good, though, in that it forces you to write more tests for more cases to cause your function to fail.

Generally, TDD is useful in that it forces you to write expected outcomes to the code. Like writing a contract for the code to fulfill.
As you think of more cases to handle, the function becomes more robust.

However, if the function is just a mathematical formula and doesn't contain any logic, like a temperature converter, it seems less useful to write more test cases for it.
If it works for one number, it'll work for any number if the formula is correct. It's not going to expand the feature set of the function.
If logic dictates that negative values are invalid, that's a different story and should be tested.
