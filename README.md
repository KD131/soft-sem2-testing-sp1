## 1. Reflections

### 1.1. Shooting

3. Blanks
4. Misfire
5. Missed the target
6. Non-fatal wound
7. Superman/cheats enabled
8. Water gun

### 1.2. Alien

> An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise)
